## Instructions

This is a Memory Game developed as part of my Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. To play, either clone the project locally and run index.html or play it online here:

Clicking a card reveals the symbol from under it. You can only have two cards revealed at once, and if they do not match, they will get flipped back. Once you get two cards that do match, they get locked into place. The game ends when you match all pairs
